This is the new home for DJRConcepts.com In the past, this site contained my portfolio of work that is of my past works and things that I have done over the last few years. I hope this new recreation of the site will offer a lot more than just what I might have done 10 years ago. I used to build personal sites from scratch which can be very easy but limiting to expansion and others that might not know how to build a webpage. I have been using WordPress myself for the last four to five years now and find that you can customize a theme to be whatever site you want it to be. Using its entire core has a great interface for anyone wanting to have a site that doesnâ€™t want it to look like a blog site. All the sites I have built for my family, friends, and coworkers have never used WordPress as a blog site but has a CMS (content management system). WordPress has come a long way to better achieve this idea and support many sites that are out there.
